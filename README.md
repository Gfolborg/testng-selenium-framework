# Selenium TestNG Framework

This is a project to practice and test my Automation skills by automating user flow for
a demo ecommerce website using Selenium WebDriver with Java.

# Tech Stack
- Java 24.0.1
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG (test framework)
- Maven (dependency)

# Features
- Implement Page Object Model (POM) design
- Used Page Factoring
- Added screenshot capture for failed tests
- Used TestNG annotations for test cases

## Known Issues/Limitations
During testing, I discovered the demo site's Login wasn't working properly:
- Valid test credentials were rejected
- Manually verified and received same results
- Next steps I would take:
  1. Document as a Critical severity defect
  2. Work with dev team to resolve it
  3. Retest once fixed
